/* Data hiding is achieved through encapsulation
 * -> the data members of the class to be made private
 * -> defining getter() and setter() methods
 * # getter() is used to read the private member variable of a class
 * # setter() is used write/modify the private member variable of a class
 * 
 * getter() and setter() methods should not have any private access specifier, recommend is public,
 * 
 * If only getter() is used then private variable should be only readable outside the class
 * If only setter() is used then private variable should be only writable outside the class
 * If both are used then private variable should be readable and writable outside the class
