/* Data hiding is achieved through encapsulation
 * -> the data members of the class to be made private
 * -> defining getter() and setter() methods
 * # getter() is used to read the private member variable of a class
 * # setter() is used write/modify the private member variable of a class
 * 
 * If a data member is private it means it can only be accessed within the same class. 
 * No outside class can access private data member (variable) of other class.
 * 
 * However if we setup public getter and setter methods to update and read the private data fields 
 * then the outside class can access those private data fields via public methods.
 * 
 * getter() and setter() methods should not have any private access specifier, recommend is public,
 * 
 * If only getter() is used then private variable should be only readable outside the class
 * If only setter() is used then private variable should be only writable outside the class
 * If both are used then private variable should be readable and writable outside the class
