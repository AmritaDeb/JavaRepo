/* A java file can have multiple classes in it.
 * 
 * If we compile a java file which has more than one class, 
 * java compiler generates a separate class file for each class.
 * 
 * If a java file has a class with public access specifier,
 * then it is mandatory for naming the java file with the same name given to the public class.
 * 
 * So a java file can have more than 1 class but 
 * it can have only one class defined as public
 * 
 * Only the public class can be called from other classes from other java files
 * 
 * We should declare the main method inside that public class only
